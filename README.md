We use a dataset containing the most popular songs on spotify from the years 2000-2019 to give the user a basic overview about the dataset.
Additionally, we included a similarity search, in which one of the songs from the dataset can be selected and the most similar songs to the input song are listed.

The dataset we used for our project is located in the data folder. The source for the dataset can be found when following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019.

The file query.py includes:

The file Spotify Analysis.ipynb includes the data visualizations of our project.
In this file, firstly we break down the structure of the dataset. To give an outline of the dataset we print samples the columns of the dataset, as well as a value description and information about the types of data within used in the dataset. Then, we include plots for the most popular artists, songs and genres. Additionally, we print the average explicitness of popular songs over the years and we check if there is a significant difference in the popularity of modes (major vs. minor).
