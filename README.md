We use a dataset containing the most popular songs on spotify from the years 2000-2019 to give the user a basic overview about the dataset.
Additionally, we included a similarity search, in which one of the songs from the dataset can be selected and the most similar songs to the input song are listed.

The dataset we used for our project is located in the data folder. The source for the dataset can be found when following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019.

The file Spotify Analysis.ipynb includes the data visualizations of our project.
